### Prebuilt Magisk
There's still a bug from Magisk that prevents it from running on WSA. So please don't use the official build yet. The download link of the prebuilt Magisk is: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSPosed/MagiskOnWSA/main/magisk.apk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSPosed/MagiskOnWSA/main/magisk.apk) and its source codes are on the magisk branch.
